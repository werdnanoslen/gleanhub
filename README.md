## Installation

1. Run ```npm install```

## TODO
1. use local google places library
1. Keyboard covered up auto-suggest list
1. Could not search by generic names, only particular place, e.g. “grocery store” vs “Publix at 123 Street”
1. Top auto-suggestions were sometimes in a different state
1. Overlapping markers on map were hard to click
1. No cancel button for opportunities dialog
1. Free response form fields prompts and yields less robust information
1. add images
1. use wireframe style when images are added
1. add social sharing features
1. stop cheating with the css map marker on the reports page
